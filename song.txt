Hello
It is me
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong

There's something here that doesn't last too long,
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.

Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do,
I take for granted that you're always there,
I take for granted that you just don't care,
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through.

Think of me,
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should.
